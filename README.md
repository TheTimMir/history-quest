# Pixi’VN template (React + Vite + MUI joy)

![pixi-vn-cover](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c67ea9f4-c91c-46ea-bfbe-6bc0d18b5de7)

This is a template for creating visual novels in React. It uses the Pixi’VN library and Vite as a build tool.
This Template contains basic functionality inspired by the widespread Visual Noval engine Ren'Py.

## Overview

For testing purposes we will recreate the visual novel [Breakdown](https://joshpowlison.itch.io/breakdown) with Pixi’VN in this guide. Breakdown is a short story that has all the features that a visual novel should have. Josh Powlison, the creator of Breakdown, has given us permission to use his narration for educational purposes❤️.

The first page that appears is the main menu. From there, you can start the game, load a saved game, or go to the settings.

The game page is in `/narration` route. It contains the text box, character avatar, and canvas for the background image. The text box displays the text of the current dialogue. The character avatar displays the character speaking the dialogue. The background image is the background of the scene.
When a choice has to be made, the choices are displayed at the top of the screen.

When you are in the game page, you can access with many features through a list of buttons located at the bottom. In this list you can save the game, load a saved game, skip the dialogue, auto play the dialogue, access to the history modal, and access to the settings modal.

The history modal is a list of all the dialogues and choices that have been displayed.

The settings modal allows you to change the text speed, go to full screen, edit theme colors, and change go to main menu. The settings for the audio have not been added nor the libraries to manage it, but I recommend adding them.

### Keyboard shortcuts (hotkeys)

* `Space` or `Enter`: Continue the dialogue.
* `Keep Space` or `Keep Enter`: Skip the dialogue.
* `Alt` + `S`: Quick save the game.
* `Alt` + `L`: Quick load the game.
* `Alt` + `H`: Open the history modal.
* `Esc`: Open the settings modal.
* `Alt` + `V`: Hide the UI (Show only the canvas).

## *ink* - Custom hashtag scripts

By using the [onInkHashtagScript](https://pixi-vn.web.app/ink/ink-hashtag.html) function, in this template the following features have been added.

**Moving between screens**: This feature allows you to navigate between different screens. The syntax is as follows:

`#` + `navigate` + `[route]`

`route`: The route/path to navigate to. Read more about routes in the [Router documentation](https://pixi-vn.web.app/start/interface-navigate.html).

```ink
#navigate /narration
```

**Rename the character**: This feature allows you to change the name of the character speaking. The syntax is as follows:

`#` + `rename` + `[character id]` + `[new name]`

### *ink* - ink files in the project

The `ink` folder contains the *ink* files that will be used in the game. In this project, all files `.ink`, that are in the `ink` folder, will be included automatically in the project. You can change this behavior by modifying the `src/utils/ink-utility.ts` file.

### *ink* - Writing/testing the narrative with Inky

To write and test the narrative, you can use the **Inky editor**. Inky is a tool for writing interactive fiction using the Ink language. Of course, the special features introduced by pixi-vn will not be ignored by Inky. You can download it [here](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/).

To use Inky with this template, you can open the `src/main.ink` file in Inky.

```ink
// main.ink
INCLUDE ink/start.ink
INCLUDE ink/second.ink
-> start
```

```bash
npm start
```

This command will start the development server. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

### Debugging the web application

If you are using Visual Studio Code, you can use the debug configuration provided with the template. To do this, after launching `npm start`, go to the debug section and select the `Launch Chrome` configuration.
